Toxicity Classification ProjectThis project involves building machine learning models to classify the toxicity of tweets. The dataset used is a balanced dataset containing tweets labeled as toxic or non-toxic. Various preprocessing steps were applied to the text data, followed by training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.Table of ContentsDatasetPreprocessingModel Training and EvaluationResultsDependenciesUsageDatasetThe dataset used in this project is stored in FinalBalancedDataset.csv. It contains the following columns:id: Unique identifier for each tweetToxicity: Label indicating whether the tweet is toxic (1) or non-toxic (0)tweet: The tweet textThe dataset contains 56,745 rows.PreprocessingDropping Unnecessary Columns: Removed the 'Unnamed: 0' column which was not useful for analysis.Text Cleaning:Removed punctuations and digits from the tweet text.Converted text to lowercase.Stop Words Removal: Used SpaCy to remove common stop words from the text.Lemmatization: Applied lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.Model Training and EvaluationFeature ExtractionTwo types of feature extraction techniques were used:Bag of Words (CountVectorizer): Extracted word counts.TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer): Extracted term frequency-inverse document frequency values.ModelsThe following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:Support Vector Classifier (SVC)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighborsClassifier)Logistic RegressionDecision Tree ClassifierRandom Forest ClassifierMultinomial Naive BayesEvaluation MetricsFor each model, the following metrics were calculated on both the training and test sets:AccuracyPrecisionRecallF1 ScoreConfusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves were plotted for visualizing the performance.ResultsThe results of the models are summarized below:Model Performance on Train and Test Sets # Replace with the path to the generated plotsROC-AUC Curves # Replace with the path to the generated ROC curvesDependenciesThe project requires the following Python libraries:pandasnumpyscikit-learnmatplotlibseabornnltkspacygensimTo install the dependencies, run:bashCopy codepip install -r requirements.txt
UsageClone the 
cd toxicity-classification

Download and Place Dataset:
Place FinalBalancedDataset.csv in the project directory.Run the Preprocessing and Modeling Script:bashCopy codepython run_classification.py
This will perform preprocessing, train the models, and generate the performance plots.Review Results:
Review the generated plots in the output directory to compare model performances.
